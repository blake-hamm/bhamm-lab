These docs provide a comprehensive guide to the bhamm-lab.com infrastructure, processes, and best practices. Primarily, this is used for my own sanity and reference, but I hope it will inspires others as well. The documentation is organized into five main sections:

- **[Architecture](architecture/index.md):**
  Detailed documentation of my lab's design and structure as well as my design principles.

- **[AI](ai/index.md):**
  AI/ML workloads in my lab and future plans.

- **[Backups](backups/index.md):**
  Disaster recovery processes and strategies.

- **[Deployments](deployments/index.md):**
  Procedures for provisioning new resources and deploying changes, using CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, and Argo CD.

- **[Operations](operations/index.md):**
  Day-to-day operational practices, monitoring, and troubleshooting guides.

- **[Security](security/index.md):**
  Policies, practices, and tools that secure our environment and ensure adherence to industry standards.
