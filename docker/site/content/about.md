I am a data-driven professional motivated by learning, creativity, and sustainable practices. With over 8 years of experience in **full-stack data science**, I bridge the gap between complex algorithms and production-grade infrastructure.

Currently, I work as a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** at [phData](https://www.phdata.io/), specializing in Generative AI, MLOps, and scalable data systems. My expertise spans the entire ml lifecycle—from data engineering and statistics to building actionable visualization tools, deploying infrastructure as code, and building production GenAI applications with FastAPI endpoints and evaluations. I don't just build models; I build the pipelines, APIs, and CI/CD workflows that make them robust and valuable.

### Technical Expertise

My work is defined by a "full-stack" approach to AI and data. I have led high-stakes initiatives for companies like **MetLife**, **Fidelity Investments**, and **Capital One**, and optimized demand planning and supply chain for global brands like **Salomon** and **Smith Optics**.

*   **Generative AI & LLMs:** Architecting RAG agents, optimizing vector stores (Redis), fine-tuning foundation models and evaluating real-world performance with DSPy.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing scalable deployments using Terraform, Ansible, and GitOps (ArgoCD) on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE).
*   **Engineering & Analytics:** Reducing compute costs, latency and improving data reliability using dbt, Prefect, Argo Workflows, and modern data warehousing techniques.
*   **Observability & Logging**: Deploying robust monitoring with LangGraph, LangSmith, MLflow, Grafana and NewRelic

### The Homelab & Passion Projects

I believe the best way to master a technology is to break it in a controlled environment. My "passion projects" are a testing ground for the latest in open-source tech, from bare-metal Kubernetes clusters to self-hosted AI apps.

You can explore my documentation at [docs.bhamm-lab.com](https://docs.bhamm-lab.com) or view the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/blake-hamm/bhamm-lab).

#### Current Lab Highlights
*   **Infrastructure:** A hybrid setup running **NixOS** and **Talos Linux** on bare metal, orchestrated with Kubernetes and managed with ArgoCD, Terraform and Ansible.
*   **Local AI:** Experimenting with local LLM inference (llama.cpp), search (searnxg), vector db (qdrant) and hardware acceleration (ROCm/Vulkan) to run models like Qwen and GLM Air independent of the cloud.
*   **Disaster Recover:** Keep the wife happy with 3-2-1 backups for media (Immich and Jellyfin) to local seaweedfs and minio and offsite cloudflare R2 bucket orchestrated with k8up and argo workflows.

*PS: You're viewing this website from my homelab!*

#### Featured Projects
*   **[`rpi-truck`](https://github.com/blake-hamm/rpi-truck)**: An IoT project streaming OBD2 vehicle data to a Plotly/Flask app via Airflow.
*   **[`lighthearted`](https://github.com/blake-hamm/lighthearted)**: A GenAI-powered mental health application.
*   **[`Air_Quality_Analysis`](https://github.com/blake-hamm/Air_Quality_Analysis)**: Forecasting Salt Lake City air quality using LSTM neural networks.

### The Snowboarder

Before I was optimizing neural networks, I was optimizing competition lines.

For several years, I pursued a professional snowboarding career, culminating in a spot on the **Freeride World Tour (FWT)**—the premier big mountain competition series in the world.

*   **World Rank #3 (2019):** Finished the 2019 season ranked 3rd globally in Men’s Snowboard.
*   **1st Place, Ordino Arcalís (2019):** Took the top spot on the podium in Andorra with a run that combined technical big mountain riding with freestyle elements.
*   **FWQ Champion (2017):** Won the Freeride World Qualifier Region 2 title to secure my spot on the main tour.

This background taught me how to perform under immense pressure and assess dynamic risks—skills that translate directly to navigating complex engineering roadmaps.

### Personal Life

When I'm not in the cloud or on the mountain, I am grounded in my community in **Ogden, Utah**. I am happily married and the proud "dad" to three pups who keep me active and outdoors.

I am deeply passionate about my local community and believe in using technology to drive sustainable, positive change.

### Let's Collaborate

I am currently open to projects, particularly those involving non-profits, GenAI strategy, MLOps implementation, or complex machine learning engineering challenges.
