From a young age, I've been fascinated with technology. Here's a quick timeline:
- 2005: borrowed my mom's Palm Pilot for mobile games
- 2010: built my first desktop gaming pc
- 2015: introduced to data science with Rstudio in Econometrics
- 2020: deployed pihole for v1 of my homelab
- 2025: self-hosted my first website

Most of all, **I am a curious person and enjoy learning**. Often, this evolves into an obsession and I go dark to learn about some unique technology. Most recently, this was self hosting open source LLM's on AMD hardware. After my knowledge appetite is full, I move on to something new, but with the skillset to revisit and iterate on previous learnings.

Currently, I work as a **Senior AI/ML Engineer and Consultant** at [phData](https://www.phdata.io/), where I specialize in production-ready, Generative AI applications, LLMOps infrastructure and AI/ML strategy. My day to day consists of building agents and agentic workflows, eval pipelines, adjusting API endpoints, and iterating on CI/CD systems. I also work with business stakeholders to triage product feature requests and translate to architecture and execution roadmaps.

Dating back to 2017, I've worked on traditional ML systems like text classification, time series forecasting and anomaly detection. I enjoy both traditional ML and GenAI development and have worked on both green-field poc's and well-established, patented models. However, **I am most fullfilled when managing production AI/ML platforms and modernizing MLOps/LLMOps across teams**.

### Technical Expertise

My experience is "full-stack" data science. I have led AI initiatives for companies like **MetLife**, **Fidelity Investments**, and **Capital One**, and optimized demand planning and supply chain for global brands like **Salomon** and **Smith Optics**.

*   **Generative AI & LLMs:** Architecting RAG agents, optimizing vector stores (Redis), finetuning LoRa for specific use cases, evaluating real-world performance with DSPy and reducing latency with semantic model and agent routing.
*   **Observability & Evals**: Establish GenAI and ML eval pipelines as part of CI/CD and canary deployments; establish production monitoring systems to identify data and model drift with LangGraph, LangSmith, MLflow, Grafana and NewRelic.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing scalable deployments using Terraform, Ansible, and GitOps (ArgoCD) on Kubernetes in multiple cloud environments including AWS, GCP, MS Azure and Cloudflare; holder of two [AWS certifications](/portfolio/certifications/).
*   **Data Engineering & Analytics:** Reducing compute costs and improving data reliability using dbt, Prefect, Argo Workflows, and modern data warehousing techniques; building business analytics dashboards in Tableau, PowerBI, and Python.
*   **Data Science:** Exploratory data analysis and data mining; supply chain optimization (raw materials purchasing, manufacturing scheduling), time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and text classification.

### Homelab & Other Projects

The best way for me to learn new technologies is hands on. YouTube videos only go so far, but are usually the starting point. My homelab and personal projects are a testing ground for the latest in open-source tech, from bare-metal Kubernetes clusters to self-hosted AI apps.

#### Current Lab Highlights
*   **Infrastructure:** A hybrid setup running **Proxmox** and **Talos Linux**, orchestrated with Kubernetes and managed with ArgoCD, Terraform and Ansible.
*   **Local AI:** Experimenting with local LLM inference (llama.cpp), search (searnxg), vector db (qdrant) and hardware acceleration (ROCm/Vulkan) to run models like Qwen and GLM privately.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Ensuring data integrity with a 3-2-1 backup strategy for persistent volumes and databases using local object storage (Minio) and offsite cloud backups (Cloudflare R2), orchestrated with K8up and Argo Workflows.

### Snowboarding and Outdoors

If you're still reading at this point, you may think I'm a basement dweller who wears thigh socks and uses [Arch (BTW)](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-btw-I-use-arch). First off, I prefer [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) to [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)...

Moreover, I competed at the highest level of freeride snowboarding for 3 years and still enjoy the occasional contest. While I was on the [Freeride World Tour (FWT)](https://www.freerideworldtour.com/), I achieved:

*   **World Rank #3 (2019):** Finished the 2019 season ranked 3rd globally in Men’s Snowboard.
*   **1st Place, Ordino Arcalís (2019):** Took the top spot on the podium in Andorra with a run that combined technical big mountain riding with freestyle elements.
*   **FWQ Champion (2017):** Won the Freeride World Qualifier Region 2 title to secure my spot on the main tour.

But enough of the ego boosting.. What it really comes down to is I appreciate and prioritize work-life balance. A perfect day for me is developing AI/ML pipelines, pow laps on [Paradise lift](https://liftblog.com/paradise-express-powder-mountain-ut/), deploying a new feature in the homelab and wrapping up with some spring park jumps. During the summer, I enjoy a round of disc golf, paddleboarding, backpacking or a long trail run.

I find that balancing screen time with the outdoors allows me to do my best work. It improves my mindfulness practice and enables me to find flow state in all aspects of my life.

### Personal Life

When I'm not on a terminal or the mountain, I am grounded in my community of [Ogden, Utah](https://www.ogdencity.gov/). I am happily married and the proud "dad" to three pups who keep me busy.

I am deeply passionate about my local community and believe in using technology to drive sustainable, positive change.

#### *Let's Collaborate!*

I am open to projects, particularly those involving non-profits, AI strategy, MLOps development, or complex machine learning engineering challenges.
