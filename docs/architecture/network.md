# Network Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the network architecture of the lab, detailing both the physical and logical components that ensure robust, secure, and scalable connectivity. It covers the topology, key network devices, VLAN segmentation, IP addressing, cabling infrastructure, and security policies.

## Topology & Diagrams
- **Physical Topology:**
  Describes how network devices are physically connected, including the layout of core, distribution, and access layers.

- **Logical Topology:**
  Explains how network traffic is segmented via VLANs and subnets, including routing and segmentation strategies.

- **Diagrams & Visuals:**
  Include high-level network diagrams, connectivity schematics, and detailed layout images.

## Network Components
### Core Network Devices
- **Core Switches & Routers:**
  These devices form the backbone of the lab network, aggregating traffic from various subnets and ensuring reliable connectivity.
  - **Example:**
    - **Device:** Core Switch
      **Model:** Cisco Catalyst 9300
      **Role:** Aggregation and routing between lab segments

### Distribution and Access Layers
- **Distribution Layer:**
  Aggregates traffic from multiple access switches, providing routing between different VLANs or subnets.

- **Access Layer:**
  Connects end devices (servers, workstations, IoT devices) to the network. Typically includes switches and wireless access points.

- **Redundancy:**
  The design incorporates redundant links between key devices to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Firewall and Security Appliances
- **Firewalls & IDS/IPS:**
  Dedicated security devices that monitor, filter, and protect network traffic.
  - **Example:**
    - **Device:** Next-Generation Firewall
      **Role:** Enforce security policies and detect potential intrusions

## VLANs & IP Addressing
- **VLAN Segmentation:**
  - Different VLANs are used to isolate traffic by function, tenant, or security level.
  - Document the VLAN IDs, associated subnets, and their intended purposes.

- **IP Addressing Scheme:**
  - Outline the IP ranges allocated to each subnet.
  - Define the roles of key IP addresses such as gateways, DNS, and DHCP servers.
  - *Example:*
    - **VLAN 10 (Management):** 192.168.10.0/24
    - **VLAN 20 (Production):** 192.168.20.0/24

## Connectivity & Cabling
- **Cabling Standards:**
  - The lab utilizes high-performance cabling standards (e.g., Cat6a for Ethernet and fiber optics for uplinks) to ensure reliable data transmission.

- **Patch Panels & Cable Management:**
  - Describe the organization of physical connections, including the use of patch panels and cable trays to maintain order and clarity.

- **Redundant Paths:**
  - Detail any redundant cabling or failover paths that enhance network resilience.

## Network Security & Policies
- **Security Measures:**
  - Network segmentation through VLANs and dedicated subnets.
  - Firewall rules and access control lists (ACLs) to protect sensitive areas.

- **Access Controls:**
  - Policies for managing administrative access to network devices.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Overview of tools and practices used for monitoring network traffic and logging events to detect anomalies or potential security breaches.

## Future Network Enhancements
- **Scalability Considerations:**
  - Plans for expanding network capacity or adding new segments as lab demands grow.

- **Emerging Technologies:**
  - Evaluation of Software Defined Networking (SDN) or other advanced technologies to enhance network management and agility.

- **Planned Upgrades:**
  - Scheduled hardware or configuration updates to improve performance, security, and redundancy.

## Appendices
- **Diagrams & Schematics:**
  - Additional network diagrams, layout files, and detailed schematics.

- **Vendor Documentation:**
  - Links to technical datasheets, manuals, and support resources for critical network devices.

- **Change Log:**
  - A record of updates and modifications to the network architecture documentation, including dates and descriptions of changes.
