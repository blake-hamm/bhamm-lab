# Future Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the planned enhancements and future developments for the lab’s architecture. Our vision is to build a resilient, scalable, and innovative environment by strengthening failover capabilities with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), expanding the suite of self-hosted AI applications, and integrating advanced tools like Ollama and Vaultwarden. These initiatives will drive operational excellence, improve security, and empower cutting-edge AI research and development.

## Key Roadmap Areas

### 1. Enhanced Failover and Disaster Recovery
- **GCP Failover Integration:**
  - **Objective:** Leverage GCP to provide seamless, automated failover for on-premises systems during outages or disasters.
  - **Initiatives:**
    - Develop infrastructure-as-code modules to automate the migration of workloads to GCP when necessary.
    - Establish automated backup routines and real-time synchronization between on-premises systems and GCP storage.
    - Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to validate and refine failover procedures.

### 2. Expansion of Self-Hosted AI Applications
- **Objective:** Broaden the range of self-hosted AI tools and applications to support research, development, and experimentation.
- **Initiatives:**
  - **Ollama:**
    - **Purpose:** Deploy a self-hosted AI language model platform to handle natural language processing tasks and provide an AI-powered assistant.
    - **Benefits:** Increased control over AI workflows, enhanced data privacy, and reduced dependency on external APIs.
  - **Additional AI Tools:**
    - Evaluate and integrate other AI frameworks and applications that complement existing workflows and support machine learning initiatives.

### 3. Advanced Tools for Security and Operational Efficiency
- **Vaultwarden:**
  - **Purpose:** Implement a self-hosted, lightweight version of Bitwarden for secure password management.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Streamlined secrets management integrated with existing workflows.
    - Enhanced control over sensitive credentials and improved overall security posture.
- **Further Integration:**
  - Explore additional tools that bolster security, monitoring, and productivity.
  - Ensure seamless integration with the existing CI/CD and automation pipelines.

### 4. Overall Architectural Enhancements
- **Scalability & Modular Design:**
  - Continuously evaluate and enhance the modularity of the infrastructure to easily accommodate new tools and increased workloads.
- **Automation & CI/CD Improvements:**
  - Expand automation practices to incorporate new AI and security applications.
  - Enhance CI/CD pipelines to ensure rapid, reliable deployments across the entire architecture.
- **Hybrid Cloud Optimization:**
  - Optimize the balance between on-premises systems and GCP for backups, compute offloading, and AI API access.
  - Monitor and adjust resource allocation to maintain optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Timeline & Milestones

### Short Term (0–6 Months)
- Initiate GCP failover testing and establish baseline disaster recovery procedures.
- Deploy Vaultwarden for secure internal password management.
- Launch pilot projects for self-hosted AI applications, including an initial rollout of Ollama.
- Integrate additional monitoring and logging for new systems.

### Mid Term (6–12 Months)
- Refine and automate GCP failover processes with regular DR drills.
- Expand the self-hosted AI toolset based on pilot feedback and performance.
- Enhance automation frameworks and CI/CD pipelines to support the growing suite of applications.
- Review and optimize network and security configurations as new tools are integrated.

### Long Term (12+ Months)
- Achieve full operational readiness for automated failover to GCP, ensuring minimal downtime during incidents.
- Establish a comprehensive, self-hosted AI platform that supports both research and production workloads.
- Continuously integrate emerging technologies and best practices to keep the lab at the forefront of innovation and security.

## Conclusion
