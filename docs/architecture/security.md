# Security Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the security architecture of the lab environment. It details the measures implemented to secure the network, manage sensitive data, enforce access controls, and securely expose services to external users. The lab’s security framework is built around best practices such as network segmentation with VLANs, robust secrets management with SOPS and Vault, role-based access controls (RBAC), and secure external access via Cloudflare tunnels. These layers of defense work together to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the lab’s resources.

## Secrets Management
- **SOPS (Secrets OPerationS):**
  - Used for encrypting configuration files and secrets stored in version control.
  - Ensures that sensitive data such as API keys and credentials remain protected even when shared across the team or stored in repositories.
- **Vault:**
  - Provides dynamic secrets management, secure storage, and access control for sensitive data.
  - Integrates with automation tools and CI/CD pipelines to securely inject secrets into deployments.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.
  - Regular rotation policies and access audits ensure that secrets remain secure and only accessible by authorized personnel.

## Access Controls & RBAC
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - RBAC is enforced across the infrastructure, ensuring that users and services are granted the minimum permissions necessary for their tasks.
  - Access to critical systems and secrets is tightly controlled, with different roles defined for administrators, developers, and operators.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all administrative access.
  - Integration with centralized identity providers simplifies user management and ensures consistent access policies across the lab.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - Detailed logs of access attempts, configuration changes, and system events are maintained to support security audits and forensic analysis.

## Service Exposure & Cloudflare Tunnels
- **Cloudflare Tunnels:**
  - External services are exposed securely using Cloudflare tunnels, which establish encrypted, authenticated connections between the lab and Cloudflare’s network.
  - This approach hides the origin IP addresses, mitigates DDoS risks, and provides a secure gateway for remote access.
- **Zero Trust Networking:**
  - Cloudflare tunnels facilitate a zero trust approach by verifying every access request and ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can reach the services.
- **Additional Protections:**
  - Combined with firewall rules and VPNs where appropriate, Cloudflare tunnels contribute to a layered defense strategy that protects against external threats.

## Additional Security Measures
- **Encryption:**
  - All sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and during transmission.
  - TLS is enforced for all communications between services and users.
- **Patch Management & Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - Regular patching cycles and automated vulnerability scans ensure that all systems are up-to-date and any security gaps are promptly addressed.
- **Monitoring & Incident Response:**
  - Continuous monitoring and alerting systems are in place to detect anomalies.
  - An incident response plan outlines procedures for containment, eradication, and recovery in the event of a security incident.
- **Compliance & Auditing:**
  - Regular internal and external audits ensure that security practices meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.
