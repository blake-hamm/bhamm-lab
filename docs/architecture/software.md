# Software Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the software components and architecture that form the digital backbone of the lab. It details the operating systems, virtualization platforms, container orchestration, storage solutions, automation tools, and configuration management systems that work in unison to deliver a scalable, robust, and automated environment. This page focuses on the architectural view of software systems, their roles, and their integration.

## Software Inventory

### Operating Systems & Hypervisors
- **NixOS:**
  - **Role:** Primary operating system for bare-metal deployments and base layer for virtualization.
  - **Usage:** Hosts core services, development environments, and management tools.
- **Debian:**
  - **Role:** Primary operating system for bare-metal deployments and base layer for virtualization.
  - **Usage:** Hosts core services, development environments, and management tools.
- **Proxmox:**
  - **Role:** Hypervisor platform for managing virtual machines and containers.
  - **Usage:** Provides virtualization and resource isolation for multiple lab environments.

### Virtualization & Container Orchestration
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
  - **Description:** Virtualized instances hosted on Proxmox, used for isolating different workloads and testing environments.
- **K3s/Kubernetes:**
  - **Role:** Container orchestration engine, adopting a container-first approach.
  - **Usage:** Manages containerized applications, core infrastructure services, and microservices deployments.

### Storage & Data Management
- **Ceph:**
  - **Role:** Distributed storage solution.
  - **Usage:** Provides scalable, redundant storage for VMs, containers, and application data.
- **Additional Solutions:**
  - **SnapRAID/MergerFS:** Used for backup, archival storage, and redundancy in non-critical data workflows.

### Automation and Management Tools
- **Terraform & Ansible:**
  - **Role:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools.
  - **Usage:** Automates provisioning, configuration, and management of both hardware and software components.
- **Nix:**
  - **Role:** Declarative package management and system configuration tool.
  - **Usage:** Ensures reproducibility and consistency across environments.
- **Argo CD:**
  - **Role:** GitOps continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes environments.
  - **Usage:** Manages and synchronizes Kubernetes deployments directly from Git repositories.

### Secrets and Configuration Management
- **SOPS & Vault:**
  - **Role:** Tools for secure secrets management and encrypted configuration storage.
  - **Usage:** Protect sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and encryption keys, ensuring that configuration data remains secure.

### Supporting Software Components
- **Disaster Recovery Tools:**
  - **Examples:** Velero for Kubernetes, restic for backups, and specialized configurations for databases (e.g., PostgreSQL replication).
  - **Usage:** Ensure that critical data and services can be recovered rapidly in the event of failure.
- **Hybrid Cloud Integration:**
  - **Integration with GCP:**
    - **Role:** Augments on-premises capabilities by providing additional backup, AI API access, and compute resources.
    - **Usage:** Supports disaster recovery strategies and offloads compute-intensive tasks when needed.

## Integration & Interdependencies
- **Layered Architecture:**
  The software architecture is designed in layers:
  - **Base Layer:** Operating systems and hypervisors (Debian, Proxmox) that provide the foundational environment.
  - **Virtualization/Container Layer:** VMs and Kubernetes (k3s) isolate workloads and enable efficient resource utilization.
  - **Application & Services Layer:** Software applications, storage services, and automation tools that interact through defined APIs and configuration files.
- **Automation Pipelines:**
  CI/CD pipelines tie together the management of infrastructure, application deployment, and configuration updates. This ensures that changes propagate seamlessly from source control to the running environment.
- **Secure Configuration:**
  Secrets management tools (SOPS and Vault) integrate with deployment and orchestration processes, ensuring that sensitive information is securely stored and accessed by authorized services only.

## Diagrams & Visualizations
- **Architectural Diagrams:**
  - High-level diagrams illustrate the overall software stack, showing how the operating systems, virtualization platforms, and container orchestration interact.
  - Detailed flowcharts map out the integration of automation tools with the infrastructure components.
- **References:**
  *(Include links or embedded images to your architectural diagrams here.)*

## Future Directions
- **Scalability Enhancements:**
  Plans to further decouple services and adopt microservices architectures for improved scalability and fault isolation.
- **Cloud-Native Integrations:**
  Increasing reliance on cloud services for backup, disaster recovery, and AI-driven workloads to augment on-premises capabilities.
- **Enhanced Automation:**
  Continued expansion of automation capabilities via enhanced CI/CD pipelines and more granular configuration management to further reduce manual intervention.
