# Disaster Recovery

## Overview
- **Purpose:**
  Establish a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime, protect data integrity, and ensure a rapid restoration of services in the event of catastrophic failures.
- **Scope:**
  Covers recovery strategies for critical systems, including compute, storage, network, and applications.

## Objectives
- **Minimize Downtime:**
  Define clear recovery objectives (RTO and RPO) to reduce operational disruptions.
- **Data Integrity:**
  Ensure that backups are reliable and can be restored accurately.
- **Rapid Recovery:**
  Enable swift restoration of services and data through documented procedures and tested recovery plans.
- **Continuous Improvement:**
  Regularly update and test recovery processes to adapt to evolving infrastructure and threats.

## Disaster Recovery Strategy
- **Risk Assessment:**
  Identify and prioritize potential risks to critical infrastructure.
- **Recovery Prioritization:**
  Classify systems and services based on their criticality to determine recovery order.
- **RTO & RPO Goals:**
  Define Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for different components.

## Backup Solutions and Technologies
- **Ceph:**
  - **Role:** Distributed storage backup and restoration for VMs and container data.
  - **Recovery:** Procedures to rebuild or reconfigure the Ceph cluster from backups.
- **MergerFS + SnapRAID:**
  - **Role:** Archival and backup solution for less performance-critical data.
  - **Recovery:** Steps to restore pooled storage and parity data.
- **Velero:**
  - **Role:** Backup and recovery tool for Kubernetes clusters.
  - **Recovery:** Guidelines for restoring Kubernetes manifests, configurations, and persistent volumes.
- **PostgreSQL:**
  - **Role:** Database backup strategy and restoration process.
  - **Recovery:** Steps for restoring databases from snapshots or transaction logs.
- **Restic:**
  - **Role:** File system and application-level backup and restoration.
  - **Recovery:** Instructions to recover files and directories from restic backups.
- **GCP Storage:**
  - **Role:** Offsite backup destination ensuring data durability and enabling cloud-based failover.
  - **Recovery:** Procedures for retrieving offsite backups and integrating them back into the lab environment.

## Recovery Procedures
- **Infrastructure Recovery:**
  - Step-by-step instructions for restoring hardware and network configurations.
  - Procedures for provisioning replacement servers or VMs.
- **Application Recovery:**
  - Detailed steps for redeploying services via Kubernetes and virtualized environments.
  - Instructions for using CI/CD tools to roll back or reapply configurations.
- **Data Restoration:**
  - Process flows for retrieving and restoring data from each backup solution.
  - Guidelines on validating the integrity of restored data.
- **Failover Processes:**
  - Manual and automated failover procedures to switch operations to backup systems or cloud resources.
- **Communication Protocols:**
  - Procedures for internal and external communication during a disaster recovery event.

## Testing and Validation
- **Scheduled Drills:**
  - Regular disaster recovery drills to simulate various failure scenarios.
  - Testing failover, backup restoration, and full recovery workflows.
- **Post-Test Reviews:**
  - Conduct thorough post-mortem analyses after drills or actual incidents.
  - Document lessons learned and update recovery procedures accordingly.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Team Roles:**
  - Define the roles and responsibilities of key personnel during a disaster (e.g., Incident Commander, Data Recovery Lead, Communications Officer).
- **Contact List:**
  - Maintain an up-to-date list of internal and external contacts for disaster recovery coordination.
- **Escalation Procedures:**
  - Outline steps for escalating issues when standard recovery procedures fail.

## Documentation and Reporting
- **Change Log:**
  - Maintain records of all updates to the disaster recovery plan.
- **Incident Reports:**
  - Detailed documentation of each incident, including actions taken and outcomes.
- **Audit Trails:**
  - Logs of all recovery tests and real-world recoveries to track improvements and compliance.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automation:**
  - Evaluate and integrate automation tools to streamline recovery processes.
- **Hybrid Cloud Failover:**
  - Expand the use of GCP for seamless failover and recovery during on-premises outages.
- **Training and Drills:**
  - Continuous training programs for team members and regular review of procedures to adapt to new threats and infrastructure changes.
- **Periodic Review:**
  - Regularly assess and update disaster recovery strategies to reflect new technologies, business requirements, and threat landscapes.
