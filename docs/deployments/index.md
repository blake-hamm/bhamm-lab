# Deployments

## Overview
- **Purpose:**
  Outline the processes and procedures for adding new servers, VMs, and deploying changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Scope:**
  Covers both automated CI/CD pipelines and manual/local deployment workflows.
- **Tools:**
  Terraform, Ansible, Argo CD, and custom/local CLI scripts.

## Deployment Workflows
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline Deployments:**
  - Overview of the CI/CD process for infrastructure and application changes.
  - Triggers, stages (build, test, deploy), and rollback procedures.
- **Local/Manual Deployments:**
  - When and how to deploy changes manually using Ansible, Terraform, or Argo CD from your local environment.
  - Use cases for manual intervention versus fully automated deployments.
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
  - Combining CI/CD with manual steps for critical deployments.

## Infrastructure Provisioning
### New Servers & Virtual Machines
- **Pre-Provisioning Requirements:**
  - Hardware readiness, network configurations, and inventory updates.
- **Provisioning Steps:**
  - Using **Terraform** to create/update infrastructure.
  - Verifying server and VM health post-provisioning.
- **Configuration:**
  - Applying configurations via **Ansible** (installing base OS packages, security hardening, etc.).
- **Post-Provisioning Checks:**
  - Ensuring new servers/VMs are correctly integrated into monitoring, backup, and network systems.

### Kubernetes Cluster Changes
- **Code Repository Management:**
  - Branching and pull request workflows.
  - Integration with version control.
- **Deployment Steps:**
  - CI/CD triggers for testing and deploying Kubernetes manifest changes.
  - Using **Argo CD** to sync and deploy changes.
- **Validation:**
  - Running integration tests and health checks.
  - Monitoring deployments to ensure they perform as expected.

## Deployment Tools & Automation
### Terraform
- **Usage:**
  - Provisioning and managing infrastructure.
- **Workflow:**
  - Write, plan, and apply Terraform configurations.
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines or run locally.

### Ansible
- **Usage:**
  - Configuration management for new servers/VMs.
- **Workflow:**
  - Running playbooks to configure systems.
  - How to handle idempotence and repeatability.

### Argo CD
- **Usage:**
  - GitOps-based deployment for Kubernetes.
- **Workflow:**
  - Setting up sync policies.
  - Managing rollouts and rollbacks through Argo CD.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Overview:**
  - How the pipeline is structured.
  - Tools used (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, etc.) and integration points.
- **Stages:**
  - Code linting, building, testing, and deployment stages.
- **Rollback Procedures:**
  - How to trigger and manage rollbacks if deployments fail.

## Deployment Procedures
### Adding New Servers / VMs
1. **Preparation:**
   - Verify hardware and network readiness.
   - Update the hardware inventory and network diagrams.
2. **Provisioning:**
   - Execute Terraform scripts to create or update infrastructure.
   - Run initial health checks.
3. **Configuration:**
   - Apply configuration management via Ansible playbooks.
4. **Integration:**
   - Register the new server/VM with monitoring and backup systems.
5. **Verification:**
   - Run post-deployment tests to ensure integration with the rest of the environment.

### Deploying Kubernetes Changes
1. **Code Changes:**
   - Update Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts in the repository.
2. **Testing:**
   - Validate changes in a staging environment.
3. **Deployment:**
   - Trigger the CI/CD pipeline or use Argo CD for deployment.
4. **Monitoring:**
   - Verify deployment status and performance.
5. **Rollback (if necessary):**
   - Follow documented rollback procedures to revert changes.

## Rollback and Recovery Procedures
- **Rollback Triggers:**
  Identify common indicators for initiating a rollback.
- **Steps for Rollback:**
  - Detailed procedures for reversing changes (both for infrastructure and Kubernetes deployments).
- **Post-Rollback Validation:**
  - Verify system health and restore normal operations.

## Best Practices and Guidelines
- **Testing:**
  - Emphasize the importance of staging environments and automated testing.
- **Version Control:**
  - Maintain versioned configurations and deployment scripts.
- **Documentation:**
  - Keep detailed logs and change histories for all deployments.
- **Security:**
  - Ensure that all deployments follow the security policies outlined in the Security and Compliance section.

## Appendices
- **Scripts and Configurations:**
  - Links or references to common scripts and configuration files.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Common issues encountered during deployments and their resolutions.
- **Contacts and Escalation Paths:**
  - Key contacts for deployment issues and escalation procedures.
