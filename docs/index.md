# Welcome to my homelab `bhamm-lab.com`

This documentation is for server administrator (me) to organize, understand and reference operations on my homelab.

### Manifesto
 - This homelab prioritizes automation.
 - Infrastructure as code is preferred for configuration and deployment patterns.
 - When IaC is not possible, document deployment patterns that can be automated at a later time.
 - Security is important, but learning new tools and deploying useful apps is more important.
 - Only expose what is absolutely necessary to the public internet.
