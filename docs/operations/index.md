# Operations and Monitoring

## Overview
This section documents the day-to-day operational procedures, monitoring practices, and support processes that ensure the lab remains stable, secure, and performant. It covers routine tasks, performance metrics, alerting, incident response, and maintenance procedures. The goal is to provide clear guidance for system operators and administrators to maintain operational excellence.

## Operational Procedures
- **Daily Tasks:**
  - Health checks of critical services and hardware.
  - Review of system and application logs.
  - Monitoring alerts and immediate response to any anomalies.
- **Weekly/Monthly Tasks:**
  - System performance reviews and capacity planning.
  - Patch management and security updates.
  - Backup verifications and disaster recovery drill tests.
- **Runbooks:**
  - Step-by-step guides for routine tasks and common operational issues.

## Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Tools & Platforms:**
  - Monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health and performance.
  - Log aggregation tools (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog) for centralized log management.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - CPU, memory, and storage utilization.
  - Network latency and throughput.
  - Application-specific metrics (e.g., error rates, response times).
- **Alerting:**
  - Configuration of alert thresholds and notification channels (email, Slack, etc.).
  - Escalation procedures for critical alerts.
- **Dashboards:**
  - Visual representations of system status and performance metrics.
  - Custom dashboards for different layers (hardware, network, applications).

## Incident Response and Troubleshooting
- **Incident Management Process:**
  - Guidelines for identifying, reporting, and categorizing incidents.
  - Steps to document and escalate issues as needed.
- **Troubleshooting Procedures:**
  - Common troubleshooting checklists for hardware, network, and application issues.
  - Tools and commands for diagnosing performance bottlenecks and failures.
- **Post-Incident Analysis:**
  - Root cause analysis (RCA) procedures.
  - Documentation of lessons learned and improvements to be implemented.

## Maintenance and Updates
- **Patch Management:**
  - Schedule for regular software updates, security patches, and system upgrades.
  - Procedures to test patches in a staging environment before production rollout.
- **Backup Management:**
  - Overview of backup schedules, methods, and storage locations.
  - Regular testing of backup restoration processes.
- **Scheduled Maintenance:**
  - Planning and communication of maintenance windows.
  - Procedures for minimizing downtime during maintenance.

## Automation in Operations
- **Automated Tasks:**
  - Use of automation tools (e.g., Ansible playbooks) to streamline routine maintenance and deployment tasks.
  - Self-healing scripts and automated recovery procedures.
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Automation of monitoring and operational tasks via CI/CD pipelines where applicable.
  - Integration with incident management tools for automatic alert escalation.
- **Runbook Automation:**
  - Implementation of automated workflows for common incidents to reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR).

## Documentation and Reporting
- **Operational Logs:**
  - Guidelines for maintaining comprehensive logs for all operations activities.
  - Centralized log storage and regular reviews.
- **Performance Reporting:**
  - Periodic generation of performance dashboards and reports.
  - Analysis of trends and proactive capacity planning.
- **Audit and Compliance:**
  - Maintaining documentation for audits, including change logs and incident reports.
  - Regular reviews to ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

## Appendices
- **Quick Reference Guides:**
  - Cheat sheets and command references for common operational tasks.
- **Scripts Repository:**
  - Links to commonly used automation scripts and playbooks.
- **Escalation Contacts:**
  - Contact details for support teams, vendors, and key stakeholders.
- **Change Log:**
  - A record of updates and changes to operational procedures and monitoring configurations.
