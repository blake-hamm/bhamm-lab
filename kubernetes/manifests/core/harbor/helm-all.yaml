          # gitHubToken the GitHub access token to download Trivy DB
          #
          # Trivy DB contains vulnerability information from NVD, Red Hat, and many other upstream vulnerability databases.
          # It is downloaded by Trivy from the GitHub release page https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-db/releases and cached
          # in the local file system (`/home/scanner/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db`). In addition, the database contains the update
          # timestamp so Trivy can detect whether it should download a newer version from the Internet or use the cached one.
          # Currently, the database is updated every 12 hours and published as a new release to GitHub.
          #
          # Anonymous downloads from GitHub are subject to the limit of 60 requests per hour. Normally such rate limit is enough
          # for production operations. If, for any reason, it's not enough, you could increase the rate limit to 5000
          # requests per hour by specifying the GitHub access token. For more details on GitHub rate limiting please consult
          # https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting
          #
          # You can create a GitHub token by following the instructions in
          # https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
